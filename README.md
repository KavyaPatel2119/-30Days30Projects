# ðŸš€ 30 Days, 30 Projects Challenge

Welcome to the **30 Days, 30 Projects** challenge! This repository documents my journey of building one project every day for 30 consecutive days. The goal? To push creative boundaries, improve my development/design skills, and build a diverse portfolio of real-world mini-projects.

* ðŸŽ¨ Sharpen my design and UX thinking  
* ðŸ“¦ Build a solid collection of mini-apps and tools  
* ðŸ’¡ Break out of perfectionism and embrace learning by doing
